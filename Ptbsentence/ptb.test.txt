<bos> the move stems from <unk> learned in japan where local competitors have had <unk> success with concentrated <unk> <eos>
<bos> it also marks p&g 's growing concern that its japanese rivals such as <unk> corp. may bring their <unk> to the u.s. <eos>
<bos> the cincinnati consumer-products giant got clobbered two years ago in japan when <unk> introduced a powerful detergent called attack which quickly won a n n stake in the japanese markets <eos>

<bos> oil company refineries ran flat out to prepare for a robust holiday driving season in july and august that did n't <unk> <eos>
<bos> the excess supply pushed gasoline prices down in that period <eos>
<bos> in addition crude oil prices were up some from a year earlier further <unk> profitability <eos>
<bos> refiners say margins picked up in september and many industry officials believe gasoline profits will rebound this quarter though still not to the level of n 's fourth quarter <eos>

<bos> crude oil production may turn out to be the most surprising element of companies ' earnings this year <eos>
<bos> prices averaging roughly $ n a barrel higher in the third quarter than a year earlier have stayed well above most companies ' expectations <eos>
<bos> demand has been much stronger than anticipated and it typically <unk> in the fourth quarter <eos>
<bos> we could see higher oil prices this year said <unk> <unk> an analyst at painewebber inc <eos>
<bos> that will translate into sharply higher production profits particularly compared with last year when oil prices steadily fell to below $ n a barrel in the fourth quarter <eos>
<bos> while oil prices have been better than expected natural gas prices have been worse <eos>
<bos> in the third quarter they averaged about n n less than they were in n <eos>
<bos> the main reason remains weather <eos>
<bos> last summer was notable for a heat wave and drought that caused utilities to <unk> more natural gas to feed increased electrical demand from air <unk> use <eos>

<bos> they plan to press specifically for a <unk> of rules governing exports of machine tools computers and other high-technology products <eos>
<bos> but the bush administration says it wants to see evidence that all cocom members are <unk> fully with existing <unk> procedures before it will support further <unk> <eos>
<bos> to make its point it is challenging the italian government to explain reports that olivetti may have supplied the soviet union with sophisticated computer-driven devices that could be used to build parts for combat aircraft <eos>
<bos> the london sunday times which first reported the u.s. concerns cited a u.s. intelligence report as the source of the allegations that olivetti exported $ n million in <unk> <unk> flexible manufacturing systems to the soviet aviation industry <eos>
<bos> olivetti reportedly began shipping these tools in n <eos>
<bos> a state department spokesman acknowledged that the u.s. is discussing the allegations with the italian government and cocom but declined to confirm any details <eos>
<bos> italian president <unk> <unk> promised a quick investigation into whether olivetti broke cocom rules <eos>

<bos> it seems to me that a story like this breaks just before every important cocom meeting said a washington lobbyist for a number of u.s. computer companies <eos>
<bos> the bush administration has sent <unk> signals about its <unk> policies reflecting <unk> divisions among several competing agencies <eos>
<bos> last summer mr. bush moved the administration in the direction of gradual <unk> when he told a north atlantic treaty organization meeting that he would allow some exceptions to the cocom <unk> of strategic goods <eos>
<bos> but more recently the pentagon and the commerce department openly <unk> over the extent to which cocom should <unk> exports of personal computers to the bloc <eos>
<bos> however these agencies generally agree that the west should be cautious about any further <unk> <eos>
<bos> there 's no evidence that the soviet program to illegally acquire western technology has diminished said a state department spokesman <eos>

<bos> in trading on the stock exchange of hong kong the shares closed wednesday at hk$ n each <eos>
<bos> at this price the shares would have to rise above hk$ n for subscribers to salomon 's issue to profitably convert their warrants <eos>
<bos> while hong kong companies have in the past issued warrants on their own shares salomon 's warrants are the first here to be issued by a third party <eos>
<bos> salomon will cover the warrants by buying sufficient shares or options to purchase shares to cover its entire position <eos>
<bos> bankers said warrants for hong kong stocks are attractive because they give foreign investors wary of volatility in the colony 's stock market an opportunity to buy shares without taking too great a risk <eos>
<bos> the hong kong telecommunications warrants should be attractive to buyers in europe the bankers added because the group is one of a handful of blue-chip stocks on the hong kong market that has international appeal <eos>

<bos> it 's not a show of weakness they are improving the quality of circulation while <unk> their profits <eos>
<bos> mr. <unk> said the changes represent a new focus in the magazine industry a magazine 's net revenue per subscriber or the actual revenue from subscribers after discounts and the cost of premiums have been stripped away <eos>

<bos> but for all its success <unk> has hit a <unk> <eos>
<bos> although <unk> <unk> when big news breaks it <unk> during periods of calm <eos>

<bos> its strategy in the past has been to serve as a tv wire service <eos>
<bos> it focused on building up its news bureaus around the world so as events took place it could go live <unk> and longer than other networks <eos>
<bos> it filled its daily schedule with <unk> called <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> but the shows <unk> little in content <unk> or look <eos>
<bos> now the push is on for <unk> shows <eos>
<bos> our goal is to create more programs with an individual identity says paul <unk> <unk> executive vice president for programming <eos>

<bos> and the mayor in an <unk> that bears a <unk> <unk> to prof. hill 's warned that alcohol leads to betting which leads to fights <eos>
<bos> the council 's action is yet another blow to a sport that its fans claim has been <unk> <unk> for years <eos>
<bos> obviously they 're not in touch with what 's going on says tom <unk> vice president of the national <unk> <unk> association <eos>

<bos> of all the ethnic <unk> in america which is the most troublesome right now <eos>
<bos> a good bet would be the tension between blacks and <unk> in new york city <eos>
<bos> or so it must seem to <unk> mason the veteran jewish <unk> appearing in a new abc <unk> airing on tuesday nights n p.m. edt <eos>
<bos> not only is mr. mason the star of chicken soup he 's also the <unk> of a <unk> tradition dating back to duck soup and he 's currently a man in hot water <eos>
<bos> here in neutral language is the <unk> of mr. mason 's remarks quoted first in the village voice while he was a paid spokesman for the rudolph giuliani mayoral campaign and then in newsweek after he and the campaign <unk> company <eos>
<bos> mr. mason said that many jewish voters feel guilty toward blacks so they support black candidates <unk> <eos>
<bos> he said that many black voters feel bitter about racial discrimination so they too support black candidates <unk> <eos>
<bos> he said that <unk> have contributed more to black causes over the years than vice <unk> <eos>
<bos> of course mr. mason did not use neutral language <eos>
<bos> as a <unk> of ethnic humor from the old days on the <unk> belt live television and the <unk> circuit mr. mason <unk> reached for the <unk> <eos>
<bos> he said <unk> were sick with <unk> and he called david dinkins mr. giuliani 's black opponent a fancy <unk> with a <unk> <eos>
<bos> if mr. mason had used less <unk> language to <unk> his <unk> analysis of the voting behavior of his fellow new <unk> would the water be quite so hot <eos>
<bos> it probably would because few or none of the people upset by mr. mason 's remarks have bothered to <unk> between the substance of his comments and the fact that he used <unk> language <eos>
<bos> in addition some of mr. mason 's critics have implied that his type of ethnic humor is itself a form of <unk> <eos>
<bos> for example the new york state counsel for the <unk> said that mr. mason is like a <unk> <eos>
<bos> people are fast leaving the place where he is stuck <eos>
<bos> these critics fail to <unk> between the type of ethnic humor that aims at <unk> another group such as polish jokes and the type that is <unk> aiming <unk> as well as <unk> <eos>
<bos> the latter typically is the humor of the <unk> and it was <unk> by both blacks and <unk> on the <unk> and <unk> stage as a means of <unk> their white and <unk> audiences along with themselves <eos>
<bos> in the hands of a <unk> like <unk> bruce this <unk> <unk> could cut both the <unk> and the audience to <unk> <eos>
<bos> but <unk> by a pro like <unk> mason it is a <unk> form of <unk> <eos>
<bos> why <unk> <eos>
<bos> because despite all the media <unk> about comedy and politics not <unk> they are similar in one respect both can serve as <unk> for easing <unk> and <unk> the <unk> of groups in conflict <eos>
<bos> that 's why it 's dangerous to have <unk> thought police on college <unk> and elsewhere <unk> all critical mention of group differences <eos>
<bos> as elizabeth <unk> wrote in the new york times just before the mason <unk> perhaps <unk> would not <unk> over with such intensity if honest differences were allowed to <unk> <eos>
<bos> the question is if group conflicts still exist as <unk> they do and if mr. mason 's type of ethnic humor is <unk> then what other means do we have for letting off steam <eos>
<bos> do n't say the tv <unk> because that happens to be a <unk> that in its desperate need to attract everybody and <unk> nobody resembles politics more than it does comedy <eos>
<bos> it is true that the best <unk> do allow group differences to <unk> <unk> vs. blue-collar <unk> in <unk> children vs. adults in the cosby show <eos>
<bos> but these are not the differences that make <unk> <eos>
<bos> in chicken soup mr. mason plays <unk> a jewish <unk> <unk> <unk> lynn <unk> an irish widow and mother of three against the wishes of his mother <unk> <unk> and her brother michael <unk> <unk> <eos>
<bos> it 's worth noting that both <unk> <unk> are <unk> <eos>
<bos> at least they both speak with strong <unk> as do <unk> and <unk> <eos>
<bos> it could n't be more obvious that chicken soup is being made from an old <unk> <eos>
<bos> and a safe one imagine if the <unk> in question were between an orthodox <unk> and a member of the nation of <unk> <eos>
<bos> back in the 1920s the play and movie versions of <unk> 's irish rose made the theme of <unk> between the <unk> <unk> of jewish and irish <unk> so popular that its author anne <unk> lost a <unk> suit on the grounds that the plot has entered the public <unk> <eos>
<bos> and it has remained there as <unk> by its <unk> in a n cbs <unk> called <unk> <unk> <unk> whose sole <unk> was that it led to the <unk> marriage of meredith <unk> and david <unk> <eos>
<bos> clearly the question with chicken soup is not whether the pot will <unk> over but whether it will <unk> at all <eos>
<bos> so far the <unk> have been few and far between <eos>
<bos> part of the problem is the tendency of all <unk> ever since the <unk> days of norman <unk> to <unk> about social issues <eos>
<bos> to some extent this tendency emerges whenever the show tries to <unk> us about ethnic <unk> by <unk> them <eos>
<bos> for instance michael <unk> <unk> not because he 's a <unk> jewish businessman but because he <unk> his <unk> job as a salesman in order to become a social worker <eos>
<bos> even more <unk> is the <unk> between <unk> <unk> and mr. mason 's comic <unk> <eos>
<bos> the best moments in the show occur at the beginning and the end and occasionally in the middle when mr. mason <unk> into his <unk> mode and starts <unk> out that old-fashioned jewish <unk> to other people as well as to himself <eos>
<bos> but too often these <unk> lack spark because this <unk> like all <unk> is <unk> about <unk> mr. mason 's stock in trade ethnic differences <eos>
<bos> i 'm not suggesting that the producers start putting together episodes about topics like the <unk> dispute over the <unk> <unk> at <unk> <eos>
<bos> that issue like racial <unk> in new york city will have to cool down not heat up before it can <unk> <eos>
<bos> but i am suggesting that they stop requiring mr. mason to <unk> his classic <unk> with some line about <unk> for other people that would sound <unk> on the <unk> of miss america <eos>

<bos> late friday night the senate voted n to approve an estimated $ n billion measure that had been stripped of hundreds of provisions that would have widened rather than narrowed the federal budget deficit <eos>

<bos> house budget committee chairman leon <unk> d. calif said in an interview if that 's the signal that comes from the white house that will help a great deal <eos>

<bos> opponents of the cut are playing <unk> <eos>

<bos> and a senior aide to the house ways and means committee where tax legislation <unk> said there are n't any plans to produce another tax bill that could carry a gains tax cut this year <eos>
<bos> one obvious place to <unk> a capital-gains tax cut and perhaps other popular items stripped from the deficit-reduction bill is the legislation to raise the federal borrowing limit <eos>
<bos> such legislation must be enacted by the end of the month <eos>
<bos> the senate bill was <unk> back in an attempt to speed deficit-reduction through congress <eos>
<bos> because the legislation has n't been completed president bush has until midnight tonight to enact across-the-board spending cuts mandated by the gramm-rudman deficit-reduction law <eos>
<bos> senators hope that the need to avoid those cuts will pressure the house to agree to the <unk> bill <eos>
<bos> the house appears reluctant to join the senators <eos>
<bos> a key is whether house republicans are willing to <unk> to their senate colleagues ' decision to drop many pet provisions <eos>
<bos> although i am encouraged by the senate action said chairman dan <unk> d. ill of the house ways and means committee it is uncertain whether a clean bill can be achieved in the <unk> conference with the senate <eos>
<bos> another big question <unk> over the debate is what president bush thinks <eos>

<bos> but republican senators saw no way to overcome a procedural hurdle and <unk> the n votes needed to win the capital-gains issue on the floor so they went ahead with the <unk> bill <eos>

<bos> the approval of the senate bill was especially sweet for sen. mitchell who had proposed the streamlining <eos>

<bos> i was laid off in august n and after a <unk> and <unk> job search was hired in august n <eos>
<bos> my unemployment insurance ran out before i found a job i found cutbacks and layoffs in many companies <eos>
<bos> the statistics quoted by the new census bureau report <unk> from n to n are out of date certainly as an average for the northeast and possibly for the rest of the country <eos>
<bos> i think what bothered me most about the piece was that there seemed to be an underlying attitude to tell your readers all is well if you 're getting laid off do n't worry and if you 're <unk> it 's a seller 's market <eos>
<bos> to top it off you <unk> the <unk> showing the average number of months in a job search as time off <eos>

<bos> i 'm the only one who said there would be an october massacre all through late august and september says mr. <unk> once a widely followed market <unk> and still a well-known newsletter writer <eos>
<bos> everyone will tell you that this time is different from n he says <eos>

<bos> a <unk> analyst with shearson lehman hutton inc. ms. <unk> had warned clients to take their money out of the market before the n crash <eos>
<bos> friday 's big drop she says was not a crash <eos>
<bos> this was an october massacre like those that occurred in n and n <eos>
<bos> now as in those two years her stock market indicators are positive <eos>
<bos> so she thinks the damage will be short-lived and contained <eos>
<bos> those <unk> lasted one to four weeks and took the market n n down she says <eos>
<bos> this is exactly the same thing as far as i 'm concerned <eos>
<bos> thus she says if the dow jones industrial average dropped below n it would just be a <unk> <eos>
<bos> my advice is to buy <eos>
<bos> as she <unk> it the average stock now sells for about n times companies ' earnings <eos>
<bos> she says that ratio could climb to n given current interest rates and still be within the range of fair value <eos>

<bos> friday 's fall marks the start of a bear market says mr. davis president of <unk> davis research inc <eos>
<bos> but mr. davis whose views are widely respected by money managers says he expects no <unk> crash <eos>
<bos> there was a unique combination in n he says <eos>
<bos> margin debt was at a record high <eos>
<bos> there was tremendous public enthusiasm for stock mutual funds <eos>
<bos> the main thing was portfolio insurance a mechanical trading system intended to protect an investor against losses <eos>
<bos> a hundred billion dollars in stock was subject to it <eos>
<bos> in n such selling contributed to a <unk> effect <eos>
<bos> today could even be an up day mr. davis says if major brokerage firms agree to <unk> from program trading <eos>
<bos> over the next several months though he says things look bad <eos>
<bos> i think the market will be heading down into november he says <eos>
<bos> we will probably have a year-end rally and then go down again <eos>
<bos> sort of a <unk> bear market <eos>
<bos> he expects the downturn to carry the dow jones industrial average down to around n sometime next year <eos>
<bos> that would be a normal bear market he says <eos>
<bos> i guess that 's my forecast <eos>

<bos> i do n't think the market is going through another october <unk> <eos>
<bos> i do n't think that 's the case at all says mr. <unk> a partner at goldman sachs & co. and chairman of goldman sachs asset management <eos>
<bos> mr. <unk> sees this as a good time to pick up bargains but he does n't think there 's any need to rush <eos>
<bos> i expect the market to open weaker monday but then it should find some stability <eos>
<bos> he <unk> off several major differences between now and two years ago <eos>
<bos> unlike n interest rates have been falling this year <eos>
<bos> unlike n the dollar has been strong <eos>
<bos> and unlike n the economy does n't appear to be in any danger of <unk> <eos>
<bos> but the economy 's slower growth this year also means the outlook for corporate profits is n't good he says <eos>
<bos> so it 's a very mixed bag <eos>
<bos> thus he concludes this is not a good environment to be fully invested in stocks <eos>
<bos> if i had come into friday on margin or with very little cash in the portfolios i would not do any buying <eos>
<bos> but we came into friday with a conservative portfolio so i would look to do some modest buying on behalf of clients <eos>
<bos> we 're going to look for some of the <unk> companies that got <unk> friday <eos>
<bos> john kenneth <unk> <eos>
<bos> this is the latest <unk> of the capacity of the financial community for <unk> <unk> says mr. <unk> an economist <eos>
<bos> i see this as a reaction to the whole junk bond explosion he says <eos>
<bos> the explosion of junk bonds and takeovers has <unk> a lot of <unk> securities in the hands of investors and loaded the corporations that are the <unk> of takeovers or feared takeovers with huge amounts of debt rather than equity <eos>
<bos> this has both made investors uneasy and the corporations more vulnerable <eos>
<bos> nevertheless he says a depression does n't appear likely <eos>
<bos> there is more <unk> in the economy at large than we commonly <unk> he says <eos>
<bos> it takes more error now to have a major depression than back in the <unk> much as the financial community and the government may try <eos>

<bos> new york money manager mario <unk> an expert at <unk> takeover candidates says that takeovers are n't totally gone <eos>
<bos> companies are still going to buy companies around the world he says <eos>
<bos> examples are ford looking at jaguar bellsouth looking at lin broadcasting <eos>
<bos> these sorts of takeovers do n't require junk bonds or big bank loans to finance them so mr. <unk> figures they will continue <eos>
<bos> the market was up n n since president bush took office mr. <unk> says so a correction was to be expected <eos>
<bos> he thinks another crash is unlikely and says he was <unk> at selected stocks during friday 's plunge <eos>
<bos> stocks that were thrown out just on an emotional basis are a great opportunity this week for guys like me he says <eos>

<bos> it seems to me that this is the <unk> that has finally <unk> the balloon says mr. rogers a professor of finance at columbia university and former <unk> of one of the most successful hedge funds in history quantum fund <eos>
<bos> he sees economic problems financial problems ahead for the u.s. with a fairly strong possibility of a recession <eos>
<bos> friday you could n't sell dollars he says <eos>
<bos> dealers would give you a quote but then refuse to make the trade <eos>
<bos> if the dollar stays weak he says that will add to <unk> pressures in the u.s. and make it hard for the federal reserve board to ease interest rates very much <eos>
<bos> mr. rogers wo n't decide what to do today until he sees how the london and tokyo markets go <eos>
<bos> he recommends that investors sell <unk> stocks but hang on to some other stocks especially utilities which often do well during periods of economic weakness <eos>

<bos> many people now claim to have predicted the n crash <eos>

<bos> mr. <unk> says what happens now will depend a good deal on the federal reserve board <eos>
<bos> if it promptly cuts the discount rate it charges on loans to banks he says that could quiet things down <eos>
<bos> if not we could go to n very soon <eos>

<bos> stock prices would still have to go down some additional amount before we become positive on stocks says mr. <unk> president and managing director of renaissance investment management inc. in cincinnati <eos>
<bos> renaissance which manages about $ n billion drew stiff criticism from many clients earlier this year because it pulled entirely out of stocks at the beginning of the year and thus missed a strong rally <eos>
<bos> renaissance is keeping its money entirely in cash equivalents primarily u.s. treasury bills <eos>
<bos> <unk> probably are the right place to be he says <eos>
<bos> regarding the oct. n letter to the editor from rep. tom <unk> chairman of the house subcommittee on employment and housing alleging <eos>
<bos> n that your sept. n editorial <unk> committees was <unk> inaccurate and deliberately misleading <eos>
<bos> i thought your editorial was <unk> accurate and deliberately <unk> <eos>
<bos> n that mr. <unk> supported the rights of the witnesses to take the fifth amendment <eos>
<bos> yes he did <eos>
<bos> as i watched him on <unk> i heard him speak those lovely words about the bill of rights which he quotes from the <unk> of the hearings <eos>
<bos> he did repeat those nice <unk> several times as an indication of his support for the constitution <eos>
<bos> he used about n words defending the witnesses ' constitutional rights <eos>
<bos> unfortunately by my rough guess he used better than n words <unk> <unk> on the witnesses for exercising the fifth <eos>
<bos> he <unk> his <unk> of constitutional meat between large <unk> of <unk> commentary <eos>
<bos> as your editorial <unk> pointed out samuel <unk> former hud secretary and <unk> wilson mr. <unk> 's former aide are currently being held up to <unk> for taking the fifth amendment <eos>
<bos> that certainly is not the supposed distorted reading indicated by mr. <unk> <eos>
<bos> n that his committee does not deal with any possible criminal activity at hud <eos>
<bos> my colleagues and i fully realize we are not a court etc <eos>
<bos> <unk> <unk> <eos>
<bos> by any reasonable man <unk> mr. <unk> and his colleagues have a whole bunch of people tried and convicted <eos>
<bos> apparently their verdict is in <eos>
<bos> right now they 're pursuing evidence <eos>
<bos> that 's not a bad way to proceed just somewhat different from standard american practice <eos>
<bos> how was that practice referred to when i was in school <eos>
<bos> <unk> yes something called a star chamber <eos>
<bos> of course mr. <unk> <unk> protest that his subcommittee simply seeks information for legislative change <eos>
<bos> no doubt that 's partially true <eos>
<bos> everything that mr. <unk> says in his letter is partially true <eos>
<bos> he 's right about his subcommittee 's responsibilities when it comes to obtaining information from prior hud officials <eos>
<bos> but if his explanation of <unk> is true why is his investigation so <unk> as to identify criminal activity <eos>
<bos> why not simply questions designed to identify sources and causes of waste and <unk> <eos>
<bos> such as what happened when congress wanted to know about $ n toilet seats or whatever they supposedly cost <eos>
<bos> no mr. <unk> 's complaints simply wo n't wash <eos>
<bos> n that the journal <unk> the <unk> fraud waste <unk> <unk> and abuse of the public that took place while mr. <unk> was secretary of hud etc. and so forth <eos>
<bos> no to my mind the journal did not defend <unk> fraud waste <unk> <unk> and abuse of the public trust <eos>
<bos> it defended appropriate constitutional <unk> and practical common sense <eos>
<bos> the problem which the journal so <unk> pointed out in a number of articles is not the likes of mr. <unk> who after all is really a bit player on the stage but the attempt by congress to enhance itself into a <unk> body <eos>
<bos> of course we 've also got a judiciary that seeks the same objective <eos>
<bos> the system is the problem not an individual member <eos>
<bos> individuals can always have their hands <unk> <eos>
<bos> it 's when such <unk> does n't occur that we 've got trouble <eos>
<bos> i do not by any means defend hud management <eos>
<bos> but i think the kind of congressional investigation that has been pursued is a far greater danger to american <unk> of liberty and freedom than any <unk> and yes maybe <unk> within hud could possibly generate <eos>
<bos> the last time i saw a similar congressional hearing was when <unk> <unk> joe <unk> did his work <eos>

<bos> i disagree with the statement by mr. <unk> that one should not draw an adverse <unk> against former hud officials who <unk> their fifth amendment privilege against <unk> in congressional hearings <eos>
<bos> the fifth amendment states in relevant part that no person shall be <unk> in any criminal case to be a witness against himself <eos>
<bos> this privilege against <unk> <unk> the drawing of an adverse <unk> against a criminal defendant who chooses not to testify <eos>
<bos> thus in a criminal case a prosecutor can not comment on a defendant 's failure to testify nor can the defendant be <unk> to take the stand as a witness thus forcing him to take the fifth <eos>
<bos> the privilege however has been limited in <unk> with its plain language to protect the defendant in criminal matters only <eos>
<bos> the supreme court and some states have specifically recognized that the fifth amendment does not preclude the <unk> where the privilege is claimed by a party to a civil cause <eos>
<bos> <unk> v. <unk> n u.s. n n <eos>
<bos> thus in a civil case a defendant may be called as a witness he may be forced to testify or take the fifth and his taking of the fifth may permit the drawing of an adverse <unk> against him in the civil matter <eos>
<bos> he may take the fifth in a civil matter only if he has a good faith and <unk> belief that his testimony may subject him to criminal prosecution <eos>
<bos> allowing the defendant to take the fifth in a civil matter is not based on a constitutional right to refuse to testify where one 's testimony <unk> him in the civil matter but because the testimony in the civil matter could be <unk> used against him in a subsequent criminal prosecution <eos>
<bos> <unk> the risk of such prosecution a court may order the defendant to testify <eos>
<bos> thus when mr. <unk> asserted the fifth in a <unk> proceeding particularly after presumably receiving extensive advice from legal counsel one must conclude that he held a <unk> <unk> belief that his testimony could be used against him in a subsequent criminal prosecution <eos>
<bos> the subcommittee congress and the american public have every right to draw the adverse <unk> and to <unk> with mr. <unk> 's own belief that his testimony could help <unk> him of a crime <eos>
<bos> drawing the adverse <unk> in a <unk> congressional hearing does not <unk> the fifth amendment shield against <unk> <eos>

<bos> just a <unk> <eos>
<bos> or is <unk> fear of the number n justified <eos>
<bos> in <unk> a so-called friday the 13th effect has been set up and shot down by different professors <eos>
<bos> robert <unk> and <unk> <unk> professors of finance at the university of miami found evidence that the market is spooked by friday the 13th <eos>
<bos> but their study which <unk> the n period has since been shown to be <unk> by an <unk> choice of data <eos>
<bos> in the <unk> the market took falls nine times in a row on friday the <unk> <eos>
<bos> but the date tends to be a plus not a minus for stocks according to yale <unk> a <unk> of stock market <unk> <eos>
<bos> another study found that the n <unk> the 13th in the n period had higher than average returns higher even than <unk> in general which tend to be strong days for stock prices <eos>
<bos> on the only other friday the 13th this year the dow jones industrial average rose about four points <eos>
<bos> professor <unk> says the original study titled friday the 13th part <unk> was published <unk> <eos>
<bos> in a similar <unk> he adds that the anniversary of the n crash and saturday 's full moon could have played a part too in friday 's market activity <eos>
<bos> <unk> of those during the n crash that as stock prices plummeted and trading activity <unk> some phone calls to market makers in over-the-counter stocks went <unk> <eos>
<bos> we could n't get dealers to answer their phones said robert king senior vice president of otc trading at <unk> co. in atlanta <eos>
<bos> it was like the friday before black monday two years ago <eos>

<bos> there was n't a lot of volume because it was just impossible to get stock moved said <unk> <unk> <unk> president of <unk> <unk> <unk> a new york company that makes markets in thousands of otc issues <eos>
<bos> most of the complaints about <unk> phone calls came from regional brokers rather than individual investors <eos>
<bos> mr. king of <unk> and others were quick to add that they believe the problem stemmed more from traders ' inability to handle the volume of calls rather than a <unk> attempt to avoid making trades <eos>
<bos> the subject is a <unk> one for nasdaq and its <unk> companies which were widely criticized two years ago following complaints from investors who could n't reach their brokers or trade in the chaos of the crash <eos>

<bos> market makers keep supplies of stock on hand to maintain orderly trading when imbalances occur <eos>
<bos> on days like friday that means they must buy shares from sellers when no one else is willing to <eos>

<bos> but with profits sagging on wall street since the crash companies have kept smaller share <unk> on hand <eos>
<bos> mr. <unk> of hambrecht & quist said some prices fell without trades taking place as market makers kept dropping the prices at which they would buy shares <eos>

<bos> the pace of trading was orderly he said <eos>
<bos> nasdaq 's small order execution system worked <unk> as did the automated system for larger trades according to mr. <unk> <eos>
<bos> nevertheless the shock of another steep plunge in stock prices undoubtedly will shake many investors ' confidence <eos>
<bos> in the past the otc market <unk> on a firm base of <unk> participation <eos>
<bos> because nasdaq 's trading volume has n't returned to <unk> levels traders and otc market officials hope the damage wo n't be permanent <eos>
<bos> but they are worried <eos>

<bos> there is no <unk> on the fundamental level for this crash <eos>
<bos> unlike mutual funds which can be forced to sell <unk> when investors rush to withdraw money big investors such as pension funds and insurance companies can decide to ride out market <unk> without <unk> stock <eos>
<bos> most often they do just that because stocks have proved to be the <unk> long-term investment attracting about $ n trillion from pension funds alone <eos>

<bos> you could go down n points and still have a good year in the market said james d. <unk> president of new york-based <unk> capital corp <eos>
<bos> mr. <unk> however worries that the market could go down n or n points in the next few days <eos>
<bos> it can happen before you can turn around <eos>
<bos> he said he <unk> many parallels with n including the emphasis on takeover stocks and the <unk> of computerized program trading <eos>
<bos> the only thing you do n't have he said is the portfolio insurance phenomenon <unk> on the rest <eos>
<bos> most institutional investors have abandoned the portfolio insurance hedging technique which is widely thought to have <unk> the n crash <eos>
<bos> not really insurance this <unk> was designed to soften the blow of declining stock prices and generate an offsetting profit by selling waves of s&p futures contracts <eos>
<bos> in its <unk> test the $ n billion of portfolio insurance in effect in the n crash did n't work as stock buyers disappeared and stock and futures prices became <unk> <eos>

<bos> by n p.m. tonight president bush must order $ n billion of automatic across-the-board cuts in government spending to comply with the gramm-rudman budget law <eos>
<bos> the cuts are necessary because congress and the administration have failed to reach agreement on a <unk> bill <eos>
<bos> we simply do n't have strong leadership to try to reduce the deficit and make tough choices house budget committee chairman leon <unk> d. calif said yesterday on nbc news 's meet the press <eos>
<bos> for the last two weeks the bush administration and the federal reserve have been engaged in a <unk> battle over international economic policy <eos>
<bos> the administration has been trying to push the dollar lower the fed has been <unk> <eos>
<bos> one of the things that continues to worry me is this monetary <unk> between the treasury department and the federal reserve board said lawrence <unk> a bear stearns & co. economist on abc 's this week <eos>
<bos> the administration has sent out confusing signals about its response to a recent spate of airline takeovers <eos>
<bos> last month transportation secretary sam skinner forced northwest airlines to reduce a stake held by <unk> royal dutch airlines <eos>
<bos> but he has since run into opposition from the treasury and the white house over that decision <eos>
<bos> and he has kept <unk> on how his decision might affect a bid for united airlines which includes a big stake by british airways plc <eos>
<bos> some analysts say uncertainty about washington 's anti-takeover policy was one reason that financing for the united airlines takeover fell through the event that triggered the market drop <eos>
<bos> in many ways the backdrop to friday 's stock decline is <unk> similar to that of october n 's <unk> crash <eos>
<bos> then as now the budget debate was behind schedule and automatic spending cuts were within days of taking hold <eos>
<bos> the treasury was locked in a battle over international economic policy although at that time it was with west german officials rather than the federal reserve <eos>
<bos> and concern about official actions aimed at takeovers then by the <unk> house ways and means committee rather than the transportation department were making markets nervous <eos>
<bos> the n crash brought the reagan administration and democratic lawmakers to the table for the first budget summit resulting in a two-year plan to reduce the deficit by more than $ n billion even though the deficit actually rose by nearly $ n billion during that period <eos>
<bos> but barring further drops in the market this week a similar outcome does n't seem likely this year <eos>
<bos> lawmakers and administration officials agree that friday 's drop by itself is n't enough to force both sides back to the table to try to reach a deficit-reduction agreement that would be more serious and more far-reaching than last spring 's <unk> plan which still is n't fully implemented <eos>
<bos> one of the biggest reasons that new talks are n't likely to come about is that as everyone learned in n the economy and the market can survive a one-day <unk> tumble <eos>
<bos> everybody thought we were looking at a <unk> of n that we were looking at a recession rep. <unk> said yesterday in an interview <eos>
<bos> that did not happen <eos>
<bos> they learned they could survive it without much problem <eos>
<bos> but administration officials privately agree with mr. <unk> who said a <unk> drop this week is going to force the president and congress to take a much harder look at fiscal policy <eos>
<bos> in that case there will be plenty of blame to go around <eos>
<bos> there is an underlying concern on the part of the american people and there should be that the administration has not gone far enough in cutting this deficit and that congress has been unwilling to cut what the administration asked us to cut said senate finance committee chairman lloyd <unk> d. texas <eos>
<bos> nevertheless it clearly will take more than friday 's 190-point decline to overcome the bitter feelings that have developed between lawmakers and white house budget director richard darman over the capital-gains fight <eos>
<bos> hill democrats are particularly angry over mr. bush 's claim that the capital-gains cut was part of april 's budget accord and his insistence on combining it with the deficit-reduction legislation <eos>
<bos> there is no prospect of any so-called grand compromise or deal next year because the administration simply did n't live up to this year 's deal senate majority leader george mitchell d. maine said yesterday on cbs news 's face the nation <eos>
<bos> during last week 's <unk> on the <unk> bill and the capital-gains issue there were signs that senate republicans and the administration were at odds <eos>

<bos> what is one to think of all this <eos>
<bos> doctrine and special interests govern some responses <eos>
<bos> people eager to have youth pay their <unk> to society favor service proposals <unk> mandatory ones <eos>
<bos> so do those who seek a <unk> concept of <unk> a concept imposing stern obligations as well as <unk> rights <eos>

<bos> to <unk> mandatory service is an <unk> and voluntary systems are <unk> uses of tax money <eos>
<bos> <unk> of the market question the value of the work national service would perform <eos>
<bos> if the market wo n't pay for it they argue it ca n't be worth its cost <eos>
<bos> elements of the left are also <unk> opposed they see service as a cover for the draft or fear the <unk> of youth or want to see rights <unk> not obligations <eos>
<bos> but what about those of us whose views are not <unk> by formula or <unk> <eos>
<bos> how should we think about national service <eos>
<bos> let 's begin by recognizing a main source of confusion national service has no agreed meaning <eos>
<bos> would service be voluntary or <unk> <eos>
<bos> short or long <eos>
<bos> <unk> or full-time <eos>
<bos> paid or unpaid <eos>
<bos> would participants live at home and work nearby or live in <unk> and work on public <unk> <eos>
<bos> what kinds of work would they do <eos>
<bos> what does national mean <eos>
<bos> would the program be run by the federal government by local governments or by private voluntary organizations <eos>
<bos> and who would serve <eos>
<bos> only males as with the draft or both <unk> <eos>
<bos> youth only or all ages <eos>
<bos> middle-class people or poor people or a genuine <unk> <eos>
<bos> many or few <eos>
<bos> those are not <unk> questions and the label national service answers none of them <eos>
<bos> then how should we think about national service <eos>
<bos> as a starting point here are five <unk> n consider the <unk> not the name <eos>
<bos> ignore national service in the <unk> consider specific proposals <eos>
<bos> they will differ in crucial ways <eos>
<bos> n service should be service <eos>
<bos> as commonly understood service implies sacrifice <eos>
<bos> it involves accepting risk or giving up income or deferring a career <eos>
<bos> it follows that proposals like <unk> whose benefits to <unk> are worth some $ n a year do not qualify <eos>
<bos> there is a rationale for such bills federal subsidies to college students amount to a <unk> bill without the <unk> <unk> those benefits should be earned not given <eos>
<bos> but the earnings exceed by n n the average income of young high-school graduates with full-time jobs <eos>
<bos> why call that service <eos>
<bos> n encouragement is fine <unk> is not <eos>
<bos> <unk> service is unconstitutional <eos>
<bos> it is also <unk> and <unk> <eos>
<bos> who will throw several hundred thousand <unk> in jail each year <eos>
<bos> but through tax policy and in other ways the federal government encourages many kinds of behavior <eos>
<bos> it should also encourage service <unk> by all classes and all ages <eos>
<bos> its encouragement should strengthen and not undercut the strong tradition of <unk> in the u.s. should build on the service programs already in existence and should honor local convictions about which tasks most need doing <eos>
<bos> n good programs are not cheap <eos>
<bos> enthusiasts assume that national service would get important work done <unk> forest fires fought housing <unk> students <unk> <unk> centers <unk> <eos>
<bos> there is important work to be done and existing service and conservation corps have shown that even <unk> who start with few skills can do much of it well but not <unk> <eos>
<bos> good service programs require <unk> <unk> training and supervision all of high quality <eos>
<bos> they involve <unk> to participants <eos>
<bos> full-time residential programs also require housing and full-time supervision they are particularly expensive more per participant than a year at stanford or yale <eos>
<bos> <unk> programs are cheaper but good ones still come to some $ n a year <eos>
<bos> are they worth that <eos>
<bos> <unk> suggest that good ones are especially so if the effects on participants are counted <eos>
<bos> but the calculations are <unk> <eos>
<bos> n <unk> youth are a special concern <eos>
<bos> are such expenditures <unk> then <eos>
<bos> yes if targeted <eos>
<bos> people of all ages and all classes should be encouraged to serve but there are many ways for middle-class kids and their elders to serve at little public cost <eos>
<bos> they can volunteer at any of thousands of <unk> institutions or participate in service programs required by high schools or encouraged by colleges or employers <eos>
<bos> <unk> youth do n't have those opportunities <eos>
<bos> they are not <unk> in high school or college <eos>
<bos> they are unlikely to be employed <eos>
<bos> and they have grown up in <unk> grim circumstances among family structures breaking down surrounded by <unk> <unk> and bleak prospects <eos>
<bos> but many of them can be quite <unk> <unk> by productive and disciplined service <eos>
<bos> some wo n't accept the discipline others drop out for other reasons <eos>
<bos> but some whom nothing else is reaching are transformed <eos>
<bos> learning skills producing something <unk> feeling useful they are no longer dependent others now depend on them <eos>
<bos> even if it is cheaper to build <unk> or <unk> apartments or plant <unk> with paid professionals the effects on the young people providing those services alter the <unk> <eos>
<bos> strictly speaking these youth are not performing service <eos>
<bos> they are giving up no income deferring no careers <unk> no risk <eos>
<bos> but they believe themselves to be serving and they begin to respect themselves and others to take control of their lives to think of the future <eos>
<bos> that is a service to the nation <eos>

<bos> but the officials feared that any public announcements would only increase market jitters <eos>
<bos> in addition officials at the fed and in the bush administration decided that avoiding <unk> actions and statements over the weekend would give them more strength and flexibility should friday 's market drop turn into this morning 's rout <eos>
<bos> the disadvantage at this point is that anything you do that looks like you are doing too much tends to reinforce a sense of crisis said one government official insisting on <unk> <eos>
<bos> the fed 's efforts at <unk> were partly <unk> sunday morning when both the new york times and the washington post carried stories <unk> a senior fed official saying the central bank was prepared to pour cash into the banking system monday morning <eos>

<bos> the other is that we see another major disaster like two years ago <eos>
<bos> i think that 's less likely <eos>

<bos> he says the oct. n employment report showing slower economic growth and a severe weakening in the manufacturing sector is a warning sign to investors <eos>
<bos> one strategy for investors who want to stay in but hedge their bets is to buy put options either on the individual stocks they own or on a broad market index <eos>

<bos> thus buying puts after a big market slide can be an expensive way to hedge against risk <eos>

<bos> studio executives in on the talks including officials at paramount communications inc. <unk> entertainment inc. warner communications inc. and mca inc. declined to be interviewed <eos>
<bos> but mr. <unk> who represents the studios asserts the whole production industry to a man is on the side of preserving the rules <eos>
<bos> such <unk> leave network officials all the more doubtful that the studios will <unk> <eos>
<bos> they do n't seem to have an incentive to negotiate says one network executive <eos>
<bos> and there 's no indication that washington is prepared to address the rules <eos>
<bos> that 's the problem is n't it <eos>
<bos> indeed it is <eos>

<bos> hence nbc might be able to take say a n n stake in a company such as mgm\/ua <eos>
<bos> if the transaction raised objections the studio 's <unk> operations could be spun off into a separate firm in which the network does n't have a direct stake <eos>
<bos> but such <unk> would still block the networks from <unk> a big chunk of the <unk> of <unk> <eos>

<bos> but just eight days before the rules were to die former president ronald reagan a one-time actor intervened on behalf of hollywood <eos>

<bos> walter sisulu and the african national congress came home yesterday <eos>
<bos> after n years in prison mr. sisulu the <unk> former <unk> of the liberation movement was dropped off at his house by a prison services ' van just as the sun was coming up <eos>
<bos> at the same time six anc colleagues five of whom were arrested with him in n and sentenced to life <unk> were <unk> with their families at various places around the country <eos>
<bos> and as the <unk> men returned to their homes the anc outlawed in south africa since n and still considered to be the chief public enemy by the white government <unk> returned to the streets of the country 's black <unk> <eos>
<bos> a huge anc flag with black green and gold <unk> was <unk> over the <unk> gate at mr. sisulu 's modest house while on the street out front boys displayed the anc colors on their shirts <unk> and <unk> <eos>
<bos> at the small <unk> home of <unk> <unk> a leading anc <unk> and a former <unk> in the group 's armed <unk> <unk> we <unk> <unk> stuck little anc flags in their hair and a man <unk> on an <unk> horn <unk> in anc <unk> <eos>
<bos> i am happy to see the spirit of the people said mr. sisulu looking <unk> in a new gray suit <eos>
<bos> as the crowd outside his home shouted anc anc the old man shot his <unk> into the air <eos>
<bos> i 'm inspired by the mood of the people <eos>
<bos> under the laws of the land the anc remains an illegal organization and its headquarters are still in <unk> <unk> <eos>
<bos> but the <unk> release of the seven leaders who once formed the intellectual and <unk> core of the anc is a de <unk> <unk> of the movement and the <unk> of its internal <unk> <eos>
<bos> the government can never put the anc back into the bottle again said <unk> <unk> a veteran <unk> activist on hand to welcome mr. sisulu <eos>
<bos> things have gone too far for the government to stop them now <eos>
<bos> there 's no turning back <eos>
<bos> there was certainly no <unk> the tide of anc <unk> last night when hundreds of people <unk> into the <unk> cross <unk> church in <unk> for what became the first anc rally in the country in n years <eos>
<bos> <unk> <unk> of anc and <unk> we <unk> shook the church as the seven aging men vowed that the anc would continue its fight against the government and the policies of racial <unk> on all fronts including the armed struggle <eos>
<bos> and they called on the government to release nelson <unk> the anc 's leading figure who was jailed with them and remains in prison <eos>
<bos> without him said mr. sisulu the <unk> of the others is only a <unk> <eos>
<bos> president <unk> de <unk> released the anc men along with one of the founding members of the pan <unk> congress a rival liberation group as part of his efforts to create a climate of trust and peace in which his government can begin negotiations with black leaders over a new constitution aimed at giving blacks a voice in national government <eos>
<bos> but pretoria may instead be creating a climate for more turmoil and uncertainty in this <unk> divided country <eos>
<bos> as other <unk> governments particularly poland and the soviet union have recently discovered initial steps to open up society can create a momentum for radical change that becomes difficult if not impossible to control <eos>
<bos> as the days go by the south african government will be ever more hard pressed to justify the continued <unk> of mr. <unk> as well as the continued banning of the anc and enforcement of the state of emergency <eos>
<bos> if it does n't yield on these matters and eventually begin talking directly to the anc the expectations and promise raised by yesterday 's releases will turn to <unk> and unrest <eos>
<bos> if it does the large number of <unk> whites who oppose any concessions to the black majority will step up their <unk> and threats to take matters into their own hands <eos>
<bos> the newly released anc leaders also will be under enormous pressure <eos>
<bos> the government is watching closely to see if their presence in the <unk> leads to increased <unk> protests and violence if it does pretoria will use this as a reason to keep mr. <unk> behind bars <eos>
<bos> pretoria has n't forgotten why they were all sentenced to life <unk> in the first place for sabotage and conspiracy to <unk> the government <eos>
<bos> in addition the government is figuring that the releases could create a split between the internal and external wings of the anc and between the newly freed leaders and those activists who have emerged as leaders inside the country during their <unk> <eos>
<bos> in order to head off any divisions mr. <unk> in a meeting with his colleagues before they were released instructed them to report to the anc headquarters in <unk> as soon as possible <eos>
<bos> the men also will be faced with <unk> the generation gap between themselves and the country 's many <unk> black <unk> the so-called young <unk> who are anxious to see the old <unk> in action <eos>
<bos> says peter <unk> president of the south african youth congress we will be expecting them to act like leaders of the anc <eos>
<bos> they never considered themselves to be anything else <eos>
<bos> at last night 's rally they called on their <unk> to be firm yet disciplined in their opposition to apartheid <eos>
<bos> we <unk> discipline because we know that the government is very very sensitive said andrew <unk> another early <unk> leader who is now n <eos>
<bos> we want to see nelson <unk> and all our <unk> out of prison and if we are n't disciplined we may not see them here with us <eos>
