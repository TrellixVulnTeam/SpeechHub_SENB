<bos> to combat that problem national geographic like other magazines began offering regional editions allowing advertisers to appear in only a portion of its magazines for example ads can run only in the magazines sent to subscribers in the largest n markets <eos>
<bos> but the magazine was slower than its competitors to come up with its regional editions and until last year offered fewer of them than did competitors <eos>
<bos> time magazine for example has more than n separate editions going to different regions top management and other groups <eos>
<bos> another sticking point for advertisers was national geographic 's tradition of <unk> its ads together usually at the beginning or end of the magazine rather than spreading ads out among its articles as most magazines do <eos>
<bos> and national geographic 's <unk> size means extra production costs for advertisers <eos>
<bos> but ms. <unk> says the magazine is fighting back <eos>
<bos> it now offers n regional editions it very recently began running ads adjacent to articles and it has been <unk> up its sales force <eos>
<bos> and it just launched a promotional campaign to tell chief executives marketing directors and media executives just that <eos>
<bos> the centerpiece of the promotion is its new ad campaign into which the magazine will pour about $ n mostly in the next few weeks <eos>
<bos> the campaign created by <unk> group 's ddb needham agency takes advantage of the <unk> photography that national geographic is known for <eos>
<bos> in one ad a photo of the interior of the <unk> in paris is <unk> with the headline the only book more respected than <unk> does n't accept advertising <eos>
<bos> another ad pictures a tree <unk> magnified n times with the headline for impact far beyond your size consider our regional editions <eos>
<bos> ms. <unk> says she wants the campaign to help attract advertisers in n categories including corporate financial services consumer electronics insurance and food <eos>
<bos> her goal to top n ad pages in n up from about n this year <eos>
<bos> whether she can meet that ambitious goal is still far from certain <eos>
<bos> the ad campaign is meant to <unk> the thought of national geographic she says <eos>
<bos> we want it to be a <unk> kind of image <eos>

<bos> the commodity futures trading commission plans to restrict dual trading on commodity exchanges a move almost certain to <unk> exchange officials and traders <eos>
<bos> the cftc said it will propose the restrictions after the release of a study that shows little economic benefit resulting from dual trading and cites problems associated with the practice <eos>
<bos> dual trading gives an exchange trader the right to trade both for his own account and for customers <eos>
<bos> the issue exploded this year after a federal bureau of investigation operation led to charges of widespread trading abuses at the chicago board of trade and chicago mercantile exchange <eos>
<bos> while not specifically mentioned in the fbi charges dual trading became a focus of attempts to tighten industry regulations <eos>
<bos> critics contend that traders were putting buying or selling for their own accounts ahead of other traders ' customer orders <eos>
<bos> traders are likely to oppose such restrictions because dual trading provides a way to make money in slower markets where there is a shortage of customer orders <eos>
<bos> the exchanges contend that dual trading improves liquidity in the markets because traders can buy or sell even when they do n't have a customer order in hand <eos>
<bos> the exchanges say liquidity becomes a severe problem for <unk> traded contracts such as those with a long time remaining before expiration <eos>
<bos> the cftc may take those arguments into account by allowing exceptions to its restrictions <eos>
<bos> the agency did n't cite specific situations where dual trading might be allowed but smaller exchanges or contracts that need additional liquidity are expected to be among them <eos>
<bos> wendy <unk> the agency 's chairman told the senate agriculture committee that she expects the study to be released within two weeks and the rule changes to be completed by <unk> <eos>
<bos> the study by the cftc 's division of economic analysis shows that a trade is a trade a member of the study team said <eos>
<bos> whether a trade is done on a dual or <unk> basis the member said does n't seem to have much economic impact <eos>
<bos> currently most traders on commodity exchanges specialize in trading either for customer accounts which makes them brokers or for their own accounts as <unk> <unk> <eos>
<bos> the tests indicate that dual and <unk> traders are similar in terms of the trade executions and liquidity they provide to the market mrs. <unk> told the senate panel <eos>
<bos> members of congress have proposed restricting dual trading in bills to <unk> cftc operations <eos>
<bos> the house 's bill would prohibit dual trading in markets with daily average volume of n contracts or more <unk> those considered too difficult to track without a sophisticated computer system <eos>
<bos> the senate bill would force the cftc to suspend dual trading if an exchange ca n't show that its oversight system can detect <unk> abuses <eos>
<bos> so far one test of restricting dual trading has worked well <eos>
<bos> the chicago merc banned dual trading in its standard & poor 's 500-stock index futures pit in n <eos>
<bos> under the rules traders decide before a session begins whether they will trade for their own account or for customers <eos>
<bos> traders who stand on the pit 's top step where most customer orders are executed ca n't trade for themselves <eos>
<bos> a merc spokesman said the plan has n't made much difference in liquidity in the pit <eos>
<bos> it 's too soon to tell but people do n't seem to be unhappy with it he said <eos>
<bos> he said he would n't comment on the cftc plan until the exchange has seen the full proposal <eos>
<bos> but at a meeting last week tom <unk> the board of trade 's president told commodity lawyers dual trading is definitely worth saving <eos>
<bos> it adds something to the market <eos>

<bos> <unk> device 's <unk> plays back a lesson <eos>
<bos> products <unk> have to be first to be winners <eos>
<bos> that 's the lesson offered through one case study featured in a design exhibit <eos>
<bos> dictaphone corp. was caught off guard in n when its main competitor <unk> office products of japan introduced a <unk> <unk> recorder half the size of standard <unk> devices <eos>
<bos> blocked by patent protection from following suit dictaphone decided to go a step further and cut the <unk> in half again down to the length of a <unk> <eos>

<bos> both were right <eos>

<bos> nevertheless the device has been successful in other ways <eos>
<bos> it helped dictaphone attract better engineers and it provided new technology for other company products <eos>
<bos> the <unk> recorder also helped transform the company 's reputation from <unk> to <unk> <unk> <eos>
<bos> it gave me great pride to see the inventor of the <unk> in japan look at the <unk> and shake his head and say <unk> says mr. <unk> <eos>

<bos> the harder he tried to push them into large <unk> the closer he came to breaking the rake and <unk> his back <eos>
<bos> so mr. barrett then vice president of the alabama <unk> association took a <unk> garden rake and taped it to the <unk> of a <unk> rake about nine inches up <eos>
<bos> his crude device worked the lower teeth gathered the leaves into a pile while the higher harder teeth moved the top of the pile <eos>

<bos> but other rake makers have their doubts <eos>
<bos> richard mason president of <unk> co. in <unk> w. va. says the barrett rake makes sense but it would be tough to explain to consumers <eos>

<bos> the pentagon is a <unk> house <eos>
<bos> living there for six years was really scary <eos>
<bos> the ghosts of the past are everywhere they are kept at bay only by feeding them vast quantities of our defense budget <eos>
<bos> some can be bought off relatively <unk> <eos>
<bos> during the korean war gen. douglas <unk> demanded and got in addition to his u.n. command in korea his own naval command in japan <unk> <eos>
<bos> those <unk> operations cost less than $ n billion a year and keep mac 's ghost quiet <eos>
<bos> that 's about all it costs to <unk> adm. erich <unk> 's ghost <eos>
<bos> in n <unk> and the german navy threatened to attack the panama <unk> so we created the southern command in panama <eos>
<bos> the southern command has grown even bigger since the war because <unk> 's ghost sometimes runs through the e ring dressed like gen. noriega <eos>
<bos> the command 's huge bureaucracy is needed to analyze whether leaders of coups against gen. noriega meet the war powers act 's six points cap <unk> 's seven points the intelligence committee 's n points and <unk> wilson 's n points necessary to justify u.s. support <eos>

<bos> the ghost of the soviet <unk> discovered in cuba back in the <unk> costs just a few hundred million the price of the caribbean command in key west that president carter created in n <eos>
<bos> the <unk> has n't been heard from since but we keep the staff around just in case <eos>
<bos> george marshall 's ghost is much more difficult to keep happy <eos>
<bos> we keep a lot of <unk> to him around the pentagon <unk> <unk> <unk> and such <eos>
<bos> the army headquarters on the third deck of the pentagon used to <unk> a lot of <unk> to him but the navy headquarters on the fourth deck made them stop it <eos>
<bos> you see marshall had this thing about the navy and the <unk> he wanted to make them part of the army but secretary of the navy james <unk> blocked him <eos>
<bos> now his ghost wo n't let up till it 's done <eos>
<bos> to keep him quiet we <unk> a new unified command every year or so run by the army or the air force and put more of the navy and <unk> under it <eos>
<bos> but we still hear him <unk> at night because the navy has a few ships left and to satisfy him the navy 's sea lift forces were given to a new air force bureaucracy in illinois its space operations to another command in colorado the <unk> to a new army bureaucracy in fort <unk> and the navy 's indian ocean and persian gulf forces to an army bureaucracy in florida <eos>
<bos> which brings up the worst and <unk> ghost of all the ghost of the shah of iran <eos>
<bos> when the shah died president carter was so scared that the shah 's ghost would blame him for <unk> him out to make way for the <unk> that he declared the carter doctrine <eos>
<bos> mr. carter said he would go to war to stop anyone from trying to grab iran <eos>
<bos> but that ghost would n't settle for words he wanted money and people lots <eos>
<bos> so mr. carter formed three new army divisions and gave them to a new bureaucracy in tampa called the rapid <unk> force <eos>
<bos> but that ghost was n't <unk> he knew the <unk> was neither rapid nor <unk> nor a force even though it cost $ n billion or $ n billion a year <eos>
<bos> after mr. carter was defeated in n the shah 's ghost claimed the credit and then went after president reagan and cap <unk> <eos>
<bos> i saw what he did to them <unk> <eos>
<bos> it made my <unk> dance with <unk> <eos>
<bos> why he used to lay in wait for cap suddenly he 'd leap from behind some <unk> of marshall onto cap 's <unk> and grab him by the <unk> and <unk> him till he <unk> up an additional $ n billion or so <eos>
<bos> cap added four more divisions to the army two active and two reserve two carrier groups to the navy a division equivalent to the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> and a thousand tactical aircraft to the air force <eos>
<bos> he bought $ n billion in <unk> ships and $ n billion in <unk> and equipment to fill them and <unk> them at a new $ n billion base at diego garcia in the middle of the indian ocean <eos>
<bos> he dedicated all these new forces to the persian gulf <eos>
<bos> one night both marshall 's ghost and the shah 's ghost together caught cap and threw him to the ground <eos>
<bos> before they let him go he added a thousand bureaucrats to the <unk> in tampa and renamed it central command <eos>
<bos> he gave those bureaucrats charge of all naval operations in the persian gulf and indian ocean <eos>
<bos> marshall figured it would be good training for those soldiers someday maybe they would get the whole navy <eos>
<bos> they had fun moving the carriers around but it turned out that they had forgotten all about mine <unk> <eos>
<bos> but the shah still kept leaping out at cap so cap bought a hundred merchant ships more and $ n billion of <unk> <unk> <unk> etc. in order that those seven new army divisions and three marine <unk> could unload from all those new ships and aircraft and go to war in the <unk> <unk> <eos>
<bos> then suddenly <unk> 's ghost came to visit and said what the hell are you doing planning for a land war in asia n miles away <eos>
<bos> we 'd get our <unk> kicked <eos>
<bos> lucky for cap <unk> was <unk> and soon went away while the shah he kept coming back <eos>
<bos> so the u.s. found itself paying about $ n billion in <unk> to various arab <unk> for <unk> rights around the indian ocean <eos>
<bos> we had great success in somalia <eos>
<bos> but then it turned out that president <unk> <unk> was not at all a nice person and the navy pointed out that the base he promised us in <unk> had <unk> up about a hundred years ago and anyway was n miles from the mouth of the gulf <eos>
<bos> but who 's counting <eos>
<bos> still <unk> was the best we could get so we stay in bed with president <unk> <eos>
<bos> all these reports about him committing <unk> are probably <unk> anyway <eos>
<bos> but would n't you know now that we are spending <unk> of dollars and have built those new divisions and new air wings and have positioned all these ships and supplies to fight the russians in iran the russians seem to have lost interest in the whole subject <eos>
<bos> meanwhile congress is cutting huge chunks out of the rest of the defense budget <eos>
<bos> predictably some navy guys said do we still need to keep all n army divisions on active duty and all those extra <unk> aircraft without bases and all those army guys playing <unk> in tampa <eos>
<bos> could n't we save $ n billion or $ n billion a year by shifting that stuff to the reserves <eos>
<bos> and why not save the costs of a thousand bureaucrats by <unk> central command and putting responsibility for gulf naval operations back where it belongs afloat with the task force <unk> in the gulf <eos>
<bos> and where were all our <unk> paid indian ocean allies last year when our <unk> were being attacked <eos>
<bos> questions like that really stir up marshall 's ghost <eos>
<bos> he appeared late one night in the <unk> of the new defense secretary dick cheney <eos>
<bos> marshall came <unk> in like <unk> 's ghost dragging those chains of <unk> and air wings and links with arab <unk> <eos>
<bos> he would n't leave until mr. cheney promised to do whatever the pentagon systems analysts told him <eos>
<bos> so next day mr. cheney went out and did just that he canceled the <unk> navy and cut back one carrier and n <unk> <eos>
<bos> then he canceled production of the navy 's most important carrier aircraft the f-14 and the <unk> <eos>
<bos> on the other hand mr. cheney retained all those new land forces <eos>
<bos> marshall 's ghost is satisfied for now but he 'll be back <eos>
<bos> what with halloween coming and bigger defense cuts looming more and more pentagon bureaucrats are <unk> under their desks <eos>
<bos> they know that they can hold off the ghosts only a little while longer by cutting carriers and ships <eos>
<bos> then the whole thing will start to collapse just as it did in the 1970s and the ghosts and <unk> will be <unk> through the place turning people 's hair white <eos>
<bos> gives me the <unk> just thinking about it <eos>
<bos> mr. lehman a reagan navy secretary is a managing director of painewebber <eos>
<bos> the metal and marble lobby of centrust bank 's headquarters is <unk> than your average savings and loan <eos>
<bos> for one thing there is an old master on the wall samuel <unk> david a big <unk> <unk> painted by <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <eos>
<bos> at the moment however the painting is a nagging reminder of the problems that have <unk> centrust and its flamboyant chairman and chief executive david l. paul <eos>
<bos> in an international buying spree that began barely two years ago mr. paul <unk> a collection of about n <unk> works including the <unk> at a total cost of $ n million <eos>
<bos> by midnight oct. n all of the paintings were supposed to have been sold off under orders from florida 's comptroller whose office <unk> the state 's s&ls <eos>
<bos> centrust did n't meet the deadline <eos>
<bos> the collection was at the heart of a <unk> plan mr. paul had in which the art was to do double duty as an investment for centrust and as <unk> for the s&l 's new office tower designed by <unk> <unk> <eos>
<bos> the <unk> is that the $ n million was <unk> from the funds of this federally insured institution even as centrust was losing money hand over <unk> <eos>
<bos> mr. paul had no right to buy art for the s&l in the first place it is n't on the comptroller 's permissible list without seeking a special <unk> which he did not do <eos>
<bos> besides that some of the paintings that were to grace the walls of centrust actually ended up hanging in the chairman 's estate on la <unk> <unk> off miami beach <eos>
<bos> last spring the comptroller 's office called a halt to mr. paul 's <unk> giving him six months to sell the paintings <eos>
<bos> the acquisitions officials said in a letter to mr. paul were <unk> <unk> and unauthorized <eos>
<bos> so far mr. paul has <unk> but three of his <unk> he wo n't say to whom <eos>
<bos> the comptroller 's office says it is monitoring the situation <eos>
<bos> though the agency could remove mr. paul it has no current intention to do that <eos>
<bos> it 's not like selling <unk> mr. paul says as he takes a drag on a <unk> st. <unk> cigarette <eos>
<bos> the last six months has established the quality of the collection <eos>
<bos> there 's no fire sale here <eos>
<bos> despite mr. paul 's characteristic <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> is finding that getting centrust florida 's largest thrift institution out of its <unk> investments is much tougher than getting into them had been <eos>
<bos> paintings are just part of the picture <eos>
<bos> although mr. paul has <unk> a $ n billion junk-bond portfolio to less than $ n million since april the high-yield debt market has plummeted <eos>
<bos> <unk> itself of what is left as is required of all thrift institutions by july n under the new federal s&l bailout law may well prove difficult <eos>
<bos> and centrust has other problems <eos>
<bos> late last week federal regulators ordered the thrift institution to stop paying dividends on its preferred stock a move that suggests deep concern about an institution <eos>
<bos> mr. paul has a plan to bring in $ n million by selling off n of centrust 's n branches but it has yet to be approved by regulators <eos>
<bos> it is mr. paul 's art venture however that has drawn the most attention from investors and regulators not to mention <unk> throughout the world <eos>
<bos> <unk> shareholders some of whom are suing say the chairman and his collection <unk> the excesses of speculation that set off the national s&l crisis <eos>
<bos> centrust shares have fallen sharply in price from a high of $ n in n to close yesterday at $ n <eos>
<bos> gallery directors meanwhile say mr. paul and others of his <unk> have left an <unk> mark on the art world and not for the better <eos>
<bos> collectors do n't say it 's a van <unk> anymore <unk> harry brooks the president of <unk> & co. a new york gallery <eos>
<bos> they say <unk> <unk> got $ n million for his so certainly $ n million is n't too much for mine <eos>
<bos> the great collectors we depended on such as paul mellon or norton simon have stopped buying and the new buyers are brilliant men who made money in the stock market or in takeovers and rushed into collecting <eos>
<bos> mr. <unk> an art dealer and <unk> sold vincent van <unk> 's <unk> at a sotheby 's auction in november n to australian businessman alan bond <eos>
<bos> trouble is mr. bond has yet to pay up and until he does sotheby 's has the painting under lock and key <eos>
<bos> when mr. paul moved in on the art market he let it be known that virtually no piece was too costly to be considered by centrust <eos>
<bos> he established his reputation as a <unk> in january last year at sotheby 's auction of the linda and gerald guterman collection in new york <eos>
<bos> there on one of his first shopping trips mr. paul picked up several paintings at stunning prices <eos>
<bos> he paid $ n million for instance for a still life by jan <unk> <unk> <unk> that was expected to fetch perhaps $ n <eos>
<bos> the price paid was a record for the artist <eos>
<bos> some n n of items offered at the guterman auction were sold at an average price of $ n <eos>
<bos> the rest were withdrawn for lack of acceptable bids <eos>
<bos> afterward mr. paul is said by mr. guterman to have <unk> mr. guterman the new york developer selling the collection and <unk> <eos>
<bos> he says he <unk> them recalls mr. guterman <eos>
<bos> and he tells me if you want to see your paintings you 'll have to come to my house in florida <eos>
<bos> mr. paul denies <unk> and <unk> <eos>
<bos> it 's just not true he says <eos>
<bos> mr. paul quickly became more aggressive in his collecting with the help of george <unk> a sotheby 's expert in old masters whom he met at an exhibition of the guterman items <eos>
<bos> mr. <unk> who became his principal adviser searched <unk> in london paris and <unk> <eos>
<bos> and according to one dealer mr. <unk> had a <unk> for introducing mr. paul with the phrase he can buy anything <eos>
<bos> nicholas hall the president of the <unk> u.s.a. ltd. gallery in new york sold mr. paul <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> by giovanni <unk> <unk> <eos>
<bos> mr. hall says mr. paul was known to spend a lot of money <eos>
<bos> people were interested in seeing him but it was recognized that the route was through sotheby 's and particularly george <unk> <eos>
<bos> mr. paul thus developed a close <unk> relationship with sotheby 's <eos>
<bos> mr. paul was eager to <unk> a collection for the headquarters centrust has been moving into for the greater part of a year <eos>
<bos> sotheby 's the auction house founded in london n and now under the <unk> of sotheby 's holdings inc. was hoping to stir up interest in old masters as it <unk> to build its u.s. business <eos>
<bos> european dealers continued to dominate the action in old masters which sotheby 's north america had lately been touting in this country <eos>
<bos> for several months there was optimism all around <eos>
<bos> last october mr. paul paid out $ n million of centrust 's cash plus a $ n million commission for portrait of a man as <unk> <eos>
<bos> the painting attributed to <unk> artist peter paul rubens was purchased privately through sotheby 's not at auction <eos>
<bos> in march n just n months into his campaign mr. paul was named by art & <unk> magazine as one of the top n individual collectors in the u.s. <eos>
<bos> an unknown quantity to most of the art world paul is no <unk> to <unk> spending the magazine said noting that he does n't stop at <unk> on <unk> but also spends big on art you can eat <eos>
<bos> he recently bid $ n at a paris charity auction for a dinner <unk> by six of the world 's great chefs but the final party cost closer to $ n <eos>
<bos> mr. paul says it was n't that high <eos>
<bos> the art collection might have come to rival the <unk> ' had the florida comptroller 's office not got wind of mr. paul 's <unk> <unk> <eos>
<bos> in its letter to him dated march n and shared with reporters alex <unk> the chief of the <unk> bureau in the comptroller 's office expressed <unk> that the s&l could be so <unk> when it had reported losses of more than $ n million in its two preceding quarters <eos>
<bos> the state gave centrust n days to sell the rubens <eos>
<bos> the comptroller 's office eventually extended the deadline to six months but <unk> its demands ordering that the book value of the collection be reduced to zero <eos>
<bos> in other words get rid of all the pictures <eos>
<bos> the state <unk> noted that <unk> banking practices are grounds for removing an officer or director and closed with the <unk> to mr. paul govern yourself <unk> <eos>
<bos> the state agency was particularly <unk> to learn that the rubens and a <unk> other paintings listed among the bank 's furniture and <unk> were actually hanging in the chairman 's house <eos>
<bos> mr. paul says that at one point he did indeed have eight or nine of the paintings at home and that the rest were in storage at sotheby 's <eos>
<bos> he explains that he was merely <unk> the paintings at home with some display because of the special <unk> environment required for their <unk> until centrust 's new building was ready for them <eos>
<bos> still the incident was embarrassing <eos>
<bos> it came on the heels of a number of local newspaper articles suggesting that mr. paul has benefited <unk> from his association with centrust <eos>
<bos> for instance he got a $ n million loan from the s&l negotiated at a <unk> rate <eos>
<bos> he owns n n of centrust 's shares <eos>
<bos> adding to mr. paul 's problems dealers some with vested interests insist that he relying rather too heavily on sotheby 's advice paid much too much for several pieces in the centrust collection <eos>
<bos> the $ n million <unk> on the rubens for example was a record price for the artist and maybe twice its value given a dispute among scholars about its <unk> <eos>
<bos> david <unk> the president of david <unk> inc. a new york gallery says scholars question the <unk> of the rubens <eos>
<bos> it may have been painted instead by a rubens associate <eos>
<bos> the feeling among many experts on the commercial side is that the price paid at the time was excessive in any event mr. <unk> says <eos>
<bos> it sounds like with the rubens he got absolutely taken to the <unk> <eos>
<bos> victor <unk> the executive director of the <unk> association of america agrees that mr. paul paid very <unk> for the rubens and adds that getting rid of it any time soon for a similar sum would be quite a feat <eos>
<bos> it 's not beyond credibility the rubens will someday be worth $ n million but whether it could be sold for that amount tomorrow remains to be seen <eos>
<bos> still predicting is tricky <eos>
<bos> i 'm forever <unk> by what i see making these high prices <eos>
<bos> jonathan h. <unk> the son of the painting 's former owner mrs. rush <unk> <unk> the price talk as sour <unk> <eos>
<bos> dealers <unk> of the purchase price he says were themselves interested in buying the rubens but lost out <eos>
<bos> mr. paul for his part <unk> the rubens price saying a lot of the experts have never seen the thing itself <eos>
<bos> most of them were n't even born the last time the painting was displayed publicly he says <eos>
<bos> art prices are <unk> but a good deal of <unk> is involved in <unk> statistics on sales <eos>
<bos> salomon brothers inc. the investment-banking firm in its annual tally of investment returns reported that old masters <unk> n n in the year ended june n the greatest return of any of n assets it tracked <eos>
<bos> <unk> and modern paintings not tracked by salomon are ranked even higher at n n by sotheby 's <eos>
<bos> salomon moreover gets its data on art appreciation from sotheby 's whose prices go up with clients like mr. paul in its <unk> <eos>
<bos> the <unk> <unk> from consideration the many paintings that go <unk> at auction <eos>
<bos> art indexes track winners not losers <eos>
<bos> but art that has fallen sharply in value is rarely put up for sale <eos>
<bos> also at any of sotheby 's auctions of old masters roughly one-third to <unk> of what is offered does n't sell at any price <eos>
<bos> it 's not that there are n't any bids but the bids do n't meet the minimum reserve prices set by the sellers <eos>
<bos> in january the <unk> painting that now hangs at centrust was expected to bring no more than $ n at auction until mr. paul came along with his $ n million <eos>
<bos> mr. hall of the <unk> gallery says $ n million would have been an impossible price for anyone to ask for a <unk> four years ago <eos>
<bos> but from his <unk> point it is n't that mr. paul a customer of his too <unk> for the work a <unk> painting by an artist who is not a household word <eos>
<bos> the painting is n feet wide seven feet high <eos>
<bos> rather it just shows things have changed <eos>
<bos> mr. paul boasts that he spotted bargains in old masters just before they took an upward turn <eos>
<bos> they went up n n last year and they 'll do it again this year he declares <eos>
<bos> they were a <unk> <eos>
<bos> everybody was out buying <unk> <eos>
<bos> sotheby 's vice president <unk> <unk> says the auction house has been <unk> mr. paul in selling the paintings <eos>
<bos> and while sotheby 's chief rivals in the art world private art dealers wo n't be happy to hear it she adds a number of the <unk> have already been sold and at a substantial profit <eos>
<bos> mr. paul claims to have sold three paintings at more than a n n profit <eos>
<bos> that is n't n n and the claim is n't <unk> <eos>
<bos> he furthermore denies that he relied too heavily on sotheby 's or mr. <unk> <eos>
<bos> mr. paul says he had not one but four advisers and that he never bid <unk> <eos>
<bos> after all he had the counsel of <unk> from the most reputable <unk> in the world <eos>
<bos> he says he expects to sell the collection including the controversial rubens carefully and <unk> just as it was put together <eos>
<bos> but in <unk> <unk> mr. paul 's holdings are <unk> <eos>

<bos> retailers who had good track records of producing profits will have a better chance to buy back their companies <eos>

<bos> after n days of <unk> testimony in federal court in boston the trial is being all but ignored by analysts and patent attorneys <eos>
<bos> most have read the pre-trial documents however and estimate kodak will be ordered to pay $ n billion to $ n billion for <unk> on seven polaroid patents <eos>
<bos> that may be the largest patent award ever but it is well below the $ n billion polaroid seeks <eos>

<bos> and eugene glazer an analyst at dean witter reynolds inc. said if you hired an attorney to be there all the time and give you a prediction of the eventual award i would be willing to bet that he would be off by a lot <eos>
<bos> a <unk> trial in the early 1980s determined that kodak based in rochester n.y. infringed on patents of polaroid of cambridge mass <eos>

<bos> mr. <unk> said testimony by kodak 's patent counsel francis t. carr of <unk> & <unk> showed that he worked with kodak <unk> from the outset of the project in an effort to avoid infringement <eos>

<bos> but irving <unk> a patent expert at george mason university school of law who is familiar with the case said the fact that seven patents were infringed suggests that infringement was willful <eos>
<bos> it 's difficult to be that consistently wrong <eos>
<bos> observers also wonder whether judge <unk> will use the <unk> method of determining damages which polaroid favors because it would result in a larger award or the reasonable royalty method <eos>
<bos> polaroid claims it could have manufactured and sold all the instant cameras and film sold by kodak if kodak had n't entered the market <eos>
<bos> moreover polaroid contends it could have sold them at a higher price and thus made higher profits because it would n't have been forced to match kodak 's lower prices <eos>

<bos> while monday 's rebounding markets helped other investors recoup losses many options customers and professional traders in stock-index options and the options on takeover stocks were left with multimillion-dollar losses traders here and in new york said <eos>

<bos> you could still have some very bad times ahead said mr. <unk> <eos>
<bos> it 's possible to have a n n default rate in one year because we 're already seeing big problems in the midst of a pretty strong economy <eos>
<bos> i 'm certainly not comfortable saying we 've seen the bottom <eos>
<bos> but yesterday 's rally among good junk was a badly needed <unk> for the market <eos>
<bos> many issues bounced off the floor mr. <unk> said and benchmark junk issues recovered all of their losses from friday and early yesterday <eos>
<bos> in contrast he says the stock market gained back only about half what it lost friday and the government bond market lost about half what it gained friday <eos>

<bos> i think the market is in good shape <eos>
<bos> should you really own stocks <eos>
<bos> that 's a question a lot of people are asking following the stock market 's stunning display of volatility <eos>
<bos> <unk> financially and <unk> by friday 's <unk> 190-point drop in the dow jones industrial average and yesterday 's <unk> rebound they 're wondering if an individual has any business being in the market <eos>
<bos> the answer say academic researchers money managers and investment specialists is yes as long as you approach the stock market as an investor <eos>
<bos> but they say people should n't try to be traders who buy and sell in an effort to ride the latest economic trend or catch the next hot stock <eos>
<bos> the case for owning stocks over the long-term is compelling <eos>
<bos> if you look at n years worth of investment history including the great depression and every bear market since stocks have outperformed almost everything an individual could have owned by a long shot says barry berlin vice president at first wachovia capital management <eos>
<bos> a dollar invested in the stock market in n would have grown to $ n by the end of last june according to laurence <unk> managing director at <unk> associates inc <eos>
<bos> but a dollar invested in long-term bonds in n would have grown to only $ n and a dollar put in treasury bills would equal a <unk> $ n <eos>
<bos> the longer the time period the less risk there is of losing money in the stock market <eos>
<bos> over time the odds increasingly favor the investor with a diversified portfolio <eos>
<bos> for instance ken gregory a san francisco money manager <unk> that if an investor holds a basket of stocks that tracks the standard & poor 's 500-stock index the chance of losing money is n n to n n over a 10-year period compared with n n over three years and n n over one year <eos>
<bos> if you do n't need the money for n years there 's a <unk> case for sticking to a steady core of stocks mr. gregory says <eos>
<bos> stock-market investments also help balance the other assets an individual owns says john <unk> jr. president of the institute of certified financial planners <eos>
<bos> stocks have a place in an investors ' portfolio along with real estate bonds international securities and cash he says <eos>
<bos> there are some important <unk> before investing in stocks individuals should have at least three to six months of living expenses set aside in the bank most investment advisers say <eos>
<bos> individuals also should focus on building equity in a home which provides some protection against inflation as well as a <unk> that can be <unk> in late in life to help cover the cost of retirement living <eos>
<bos> people also should n't invest money in stocks that they 'll need in the near future for example for college tuition payments or retirement expenses <eos>
<bos> you may have to sell your stocks at a time when the market takes a plunge says mr. <unk> a del <unk> calif. financial planner <eos>
<bos> but once the <unk> are covered then i would start to invest even if it 's as little as $ n says michael lipper president of lipper analytical services inc <eos>
<bos> he says individuals should consider not just stocks but other long-term investments such as high-quality bonds <eos>
<bos> despite the strong case for stocks however most pros warn that individuals should n't try to profit from short-term developments <eos>
<bos> it 's very difficult to do says donald holt a market strategist for <unk> morgan securities a los angeles brokerage firm <eos>
<bos> our markets move so fast and they are so volatile there 's no way the average investor can compete with the pros <eos>
<bos> individual investors face high transaction costs of moving in and out of the market <eos>
<bos> the cost of executing stock orders <unk> from brokerage to brokerage and with the size of the order but n n of the order 's value is an average says stephen boesel manager of t. rowe price 's growth and income mutual fund <eos>
<bos> and assuming their first investment is successful investors will have to pay taxes on their gains <eos>
<bos> that can reduce returns by a third or more once local taxes are included mr. lipper says <eos>
<bos> after that individual traders face the risk that the new investment they choose wo n't perform well so their trading costs could be sustained for nothing <eos>
<bos> it 's very tough for most individuals to <unk> the mutual funds or the market says mr. lipper <eos>
<bos> you should really think twice if you think you can <unk> the system <eos>
<bos> then too many individual investors lack the <unk> emotional makeup professionals say is needed to plunge in and out of the market <eos>
<bos> so what 's the best way to buy stocks <eos>
<bos> unless an individual has a minimum of between $ n and $ n to invest in stocks he 's still better off in mutual funds than in individual stocks in terms of getting enough attention from a competent broker says mr. lipper <eos>
<bos> still he adds i could see owning both given that individuals often have an advantage over big investors in <unk> special situations based on their own <unk> he adds <eos>
<bos> george douglas first vice president at drexel burnham lambert inc. says that individuals have a particular edge now in small to <unk> niche companies with exciting earnings prospects a traditional <unk> ground for small investors <eos>
<bos> this growth sector which usually carries a <unk> multiple about twice that of the standard & poor 's n happens to include some of the market 's most attractive bargains right now <eos>
<bos> it 's now selling at a multiple about even with the market says mr. douglas <eos>
<bos> moreover mr. douglas sees a revival of institutional interest in smaller growth stocks that could boost the performance of these stocks in the medium term <eos>
<bos> many big wall street brokerage firms who eliminated their research effort in stocks of emerging growth companies a few years ago are now <unk> coverage of this area he notes <eos>
<bos> we 're seeing a real turnaround in interest in small growth stocks he says <eos>
<bos> the pros <unk> advise individuals to stay away from the latest investment fad <eos>
<bos> they say that 's especially important this late in the growth phase of the economic cycle when there 's no robust bull market to bail investors out of their mistakes <eos>
<bos> friday 's correction presents a pretty good buying opportunity but let 's not speculate at this point in the business cycle says <unk> <unk> chief equity portfolio strategist at first boston corp <eos>
<bos> buy stocks on weakness for their long-term fundamentals he says <eos>
<bos> in the long run investment advisers say most investors will be better off using the <unk> averaging method of buying stocks <eos>
<bos> in this method a person invests a regular amount every month or quarter into the stock market whether the market is up or down <eos>
<bos> that cuts the risk mr. gregory the san francisco money manager points out <eos>
<bos> when the market is low you are buying more shares and when it 's high you 're buying fewer shares he says <eos>
<bos> otherwise if you put all your money in at one time by sheer bad luck you might pick a terrible time and have to wait three years to get even mr. gregory says <eos>
<bos> a disciplined program will work the best mr. boesel says <eos>
<bos> one of the hardest things to do is to buy stocks when the market is down he says <eos>

<bos> donald trump who faced rising doubt about his bid for american airlines parent amr corp. even before a united airlines buy-out came apart friday withdrew his $ n billion offer <eos>
<bos> separately bankers representing the group trying to buy united 's parent ual corp. met with other banks about <unk> that purchase at a lower price possibly around $ n a share or $ n billion <eos>
<bos> but a lower bid could face rejection by the ual board <eos>
<bos> mr. trump who vowed wednesday to go forward with the bid said he was dropping it in light of the recent change in market conditions <eos>
<bos> he said he might now sell his amr stake buy more shares or make another offer at a lower price <eos>
<bos> the manhattan real-estate developer acted after the ual buyers failed to obtain financing for their earlier $ 300-a-share bid which sparked a selling panic among that <unk> into a 190-point drop friday in the dow jones industrial average <eos>
<bos> news about ual and amr whose shares never reopened after trading was halted friday for the ual announcement sent both stocks <unk> in composite trading on the new york stock exchange <eos>
<bos> ual tumbled $ n to $ n on volume of n million shares and amr declined by $ n to $ n as n million shares changed hands <eos>
<bos> together the two stocks <unk> havoc among takeover stock traders and caused a n n drop in the dow jones transportation average second in size only to the stock-market crash of oct. n n <eos>
<bos> some said friday 's market debacle had given mr. trump an excuse to bail out of an offer that showed signs of <unk> even before problems emerged with the ual deal <eos>
<bos> after reaching an intraday high of $ n the day mr. trump disclosed his bid oct. n amr 's stock had retreated as low as $ n last week <eos>
<bos> some takeover stock traders had been betting against mr. trump because he has a record of disclosing stakes in companies that are potential takeover targets then selling at a profit without making a bid <eos>
<bos> he still has n't proven his <unk> as a <unk> <unk> artist said airline analyst kevin murphy of morgan stanley & co <eos>
<bos> he 's done this thing where he 'll buy a little bit of a company and then trade out of it <eos>
<bos> he 's written this book the art of the deal <eos>
<bos> why does n't he just follow through on one of these things <eos>
<bos> mr. trump withdrew his bid before the amr board which is due to meet tomorrow ever formally considered it <eos>
<bos> amr had weighed a wide range of possible responses from flat rejection to <unk> and leveraged buy-outs that might have included either employees a <unk> buyer such as texas billionaire robert bass or both <eos>
<bos> amr had also sought to <unk> mr. trump in congress by lobbying for legislation that would have bolstered the authority of the transportation department to reject airline buy-outs <eos>
<bos> yesterday mr. trump tried to put the blame for the collapse of the ual deal on congress saying it was rushing through a bill to protect amr executives <eos>
<bos> i believe that the perception that legislation in this area may be hastily approved contributed to the collapse of the ual transaction and the resulting disruption in the financial markets experienced this past friday mr. trump wrote members of congress <eos>
<bos> amr declined to comment and mr. trump did n't respond to requests for interviews <eos>
<bos> mr. trump never said how much amr stock he had bought only that his holdings were substantial <eos>
<bos> however he only received federal clearance to buy more than $ n million of the stock on sept. n when the price rose $ n a share to $ n <eos>
<bos> between then and his bid on oct. n the price <unk> between $ n and $ n <eos>
<bos> in an attempt to persuade investors that his bid was n't just a stock play mr. trump promised last week to notify the market before selling any shares <eos>
<bos> amr was trading at around $ n yesterday before his withdrawal announcement then immediately fell to about $ n <eos>
<bos> assuming that he paid a rough average price of $ n a share and assuming he did n't sell before his announcement reached the market mr. trump could be sitting with a modest loss with the stock at $ n <eos>
<bos> some analysts said amr chairman robert crandall might seize the opportunity presented by the stock price drop to protect the nation 's largest airline with a defensive transaction such as the sale of stock to a friendly holder or company employees <eos>
<bos> however other knowledgeable observers said they believed mr. crandall and the amr board might well decide to tough it out without taking any extra steps <eos>
<bos> some analysts said they believed mr. trump whose <unk> <unk> had been viewed by some as a reason to believe he would n't back out might come back with a lower bid <eos>
<bos> ray <unk> of dillon read & co. said mr. trump is stepping back and waiting for the dust to settle <eos>
<bos> i 'm sure he still wants amr <eos>
<bos> but others remained skeptical <eos>
<bos> i was never sure donald trump really wanted to take amr said john <unk> a bond analyst with shearson lehman hutton inc <eos>
<bos> what happened with united was a <unk> way for him to <unk> out <eos>
<bos> mr. trump never obtained financing for his bid <eos>
<bos> that skepticism would leave him with an even greater credibility problem should he return that would <unk> him in any effort to oust the board in a proxy fight <eos>
<bos> meanwhile citicorp and chase manhattan corp. the two lead lenders on the ual buy-out met with other banks yesterday to determine if they would be willing to finance the buy-out at a lower price <eos>
<bos> officials familiar with the talks said citicorp had discussed lowering the offer to $ n a share but said that price was a talking point and that no decision has been made <eos>
<bos> at $ n a share the group would have to borrow about $ n billion from banks <eos>
<bos> the first ual deal unraveled after citibank and chase could n't raise $ n billion <eos>
<bos> citibank and chase had agreed to commit $ n billion and said they were highly confident of raising another $ n billion <eos>
<bos> together citicorp and chase received $ n million in fees to raise the rest of the financing <eos>
<bos> but other banks balked at the low interest rate and banking fees the ual group was willing to pay them <eos>
<bos> officials familiar with the bank talks said the ual buy-out group ual pilots management and british airways plc is now willing to pay higher bank fees and interest but is n't likely to boost its $ n million equity contribution <eos>
<bos> nor is the group likely to come forward with a revised offer within the next n hours despite the hopes of many traders <eos>
<bos> the group 's advisers want to make certain they have firm bank commitments the second time around <eos>
<bos> even if the buy-out group is able to obtain financing the transaction still faces obstacles <eos>
<bos> ual 's board could reject the new price as too low especially since there are n't any competing bids <eos>
<bos> los angeles investor marvin davis whose $ <unk> offer was rejected by ual 's board has n't shown signs of pursuing a $ 300-a-share <unk> bid he made last month <eos>
<bos> in addition the coalition of labor and management longtime enemies who joined forces only under the threat of mr. davis 's bid could break apart now <eos>
<bos> the group 's resilience gets its first test today when n top pilot union leaders <unk> outside chicago in a previously scheduled meeting <eos>
<bos> union chairman <unk> rick <unk> faces the tough task of explaining why banks refused to finance a buy-out the members approved <unk> last week <eos>
<bos> the pilot union is <unk> to pursue an acquisition whatever the board decides <eos>
<bos> but if the board <unk> a reduced bid and decides to explore other alternatives it could transform what has been a <unk> process into an <unk> one <eos>
<bos> the pilots could play <unk> by noting they are crucial to any sale or restructuring because they can refuse to fly the airplanes <eos>
<bos> if they were to insist on a low bid of say $ n a share the board might n't be able to obtain a higher offer from other bidders because banks might hesitate to finance a transaction the pilots oppose <eos>
<bos> also because ual chairman stephen wolf and other ual executives have joined the pilots ' bid the board might be forced to exclude him from its deliberations in order to be fair to other bidders <eos>
<bos> that could cost him the chance to influence the outcome and perhaps join the winning bidder <eos>
<bos> influential members of the house ways and means committee introduced legislation that would restrict how the new savings-and-loan bailout agency can raise capital creating another potential obstacle to the government 's sale of sick thrifts <eos>
<bos> the bill whose backers include chairman dan <unk> d. ill. would prevent the resolution trust corp. from raising temporary working capital by having an <unk> bank or thrift issue debt that would n't be counted on the federal budget <eos>
<bos> the bill intends to restrict the rtc to treasury borrowings only unless the agency receives specific congressional authorization <eos>
<bos> such agency <unk> borrowing is unauthorized and expensive far more expensive than direct treasury borrowing said rep. <unk> stark d. calif. the bill 's chief sponsor <eos>
<bos> the complex financing plan in the s&l bailout law includes raising $ n billion from debt issued by the newly created rtc <eos>
<bos> this financing system was created in the new law in order to keep the bailout spending from swelling the budget deficit <eos>
<bos> another $ n billion would be raised through treasury bonds which pay lower interest rates <eos>
<bos> but the rtc also requires working capital to maintain the bad assets of thrifts that are sold until the assets can be sold separately <eos>
<bos> that debt would be paid off as the assets are sold leaving the total spending for the bailout at $ n billion or $ n billion including interest over n years <eos>
<bos> it 's a problem that clearly has to be resolved said david <unk> executive director of the rtc <eos>
<bos> the agency has already spent roughly $ n billion selling n insolvent s&ls and it is likely to sell or merge n by the time the bailout concludes <eos>

<bos> the house aviation subcommittee approved a bill that would give the transportation secretary authority to review and approve leveraged buy-outs of major u.s. airlines <eos>
<bos> the collapsed plan to acquire ual corp. parent of united airlines spurred quick action on the legislation introduced wednesday and approved by the subcommittee on a voice vote yesterday <eos>
<bos> the bill is expected to be taken up by the public works and transportation committee tomorrow and a floor vote by next week will be urged <eos>
<bos> the measure drew criticism from the bush administration and a <unk> shot from financier donald trump who yesterday withdrew his takeover bid for amr corp. the parent of american airlines <eos>
<bos> in a letter to subcommittee chairman james <unk> d. minn. mr. trump criticized the bill as an explicit effort to thwart his bid for amr and said it contributed to the collapse of the deal <eos>
<bos> <unk> <unk> deputy transportation secretary also sent a letter to express the administration 's opposition to the bill in its present form <eos>
<bos> rep. <unk> brushed off mr. trump 's allegations as an excuse for his own deal failing <eos>
<bos> he also said the fact that the other letter had n't come from transportation secretary samuel skinner indicated there is <unk> room in the administration 's position <eos>
<bos> mr. <unk> and other committee members repeatedly stressed that the legislation was n't a response to any particular market situation <eos>
<bos> but they cited the ual and amr examples as reasons to move quickly to enact this legislation <eos>

<bos> it 's still on the fast track and we still want to do it said one senate aide <eos>
<bos> the bill is aimed at addressing the concern that an airline might sacrifice costly safety measures to pay off the debt incurred in a leveraged buy-out <eos>
<bos> currently the transportation secretary does n't have clearly established authority to block mergers but can take the drastic step of <unk> the operating certificate of any carrier the official considers <unk> <eos>
<bos> supporters of the legislation view the bill as an effort to add stability and <unk> to the <unk> process and to preserve the safety and fitness of the industry <eos>
<bos> in general the bill would give the transportation department a 30-day review period before n n or more of the voting stock of a major u.s. air carrier could be acquired <eos>
<bos> it also would require the acquiring party to notify the transportation secretary and to provide all information relevant to determining the intent of the acquisition <eos>
<bos> the bill would allow the secretary to reject a buy-out if sufficient information has n't been provided or if the buy-out is likely to weaken the carrier financially result in a substantial reduction in size of the airline through disposal of assets or give control to a foreign interest <eos>
<bos> if more information is needed the secretary would have authority to extend the review period n days <eos>

<bos> but the nahb was created in n out of an organization that made its name fighting a <unk> administration proposal to take over all defense housing production <eos>
<bos> through the years the association has been an active member of the taxpayer 's coalition pushing for such initiatives as the <unk> amendment <eos>
<bos> yet on matters close to <unk> home <eos>
<bos> the hud budget has dropped by more than n n since n argues mr. <unk> <eos>
<bos> we 've taken more than our fair share <eos>
<bos> i would n't have a problem if other programs had taken a similar hit <eos>
<bos> but nahb support for subsidies is not related to the current housing crunch over the years the nahb has backed a host of public programs <eos>
<bos> it once pushed for a national housing production goal set by the federal government and has regularly advanced <unk> housing measures <eos>
<bos> moreover explains one hud official the nahb remains susceptible to internal pressure from members that specialize in subsidized production <eos>
<bos> the association is pushing an extensive and expensive <unk> which would substantially boost spending above the current level of more than $ n billion annually <eos>
<bos> direct federal subsidies for housing construction have proved <unk> expensive in the past and inevitably are <unk> to the benefit of <unk> developers and lobbyists as demonstrated by the ongoing hud scandal or congressmen <eos>
<bos> indirect subsidies through the fha for instance are little better <eos>
<bos> though mr. <unk> says expanding fha lending would result in no cost to the government the mere diversion of funds from other parts of the economy and from other forms of housing such as low-income to the single-family home market would result in a major expense <eos>
<bos> more important housing programs run by hud the va and <unk> are <unk> in red ink <eos>
<bos> the fha alone lost $ n billion in fiscal n the government 's equity in the agency essentially its reserve fund fell to minus $ n billion <eos>
<bos> the federal government has had to pump in $ n billion into the va housing program since n to keep the fund afloat and the va requested an additional $ n million for the fiscal year just ended <eos>
<bos> all told the federal government already guarantees more than $ n billion of mortgages <eos>
<bos> in its <unk> produced publication where will our children live the nahb does acknowledge that of course the full measure of housing <unk> can not be provided by the federal government <eos>
<bos> it points to the <unk> impact of local government regulation particularly <unk> and building fees which <unk> the price of housing out of the reach of <unk> and <unk> people <eos>
<bos> but while the nahb has suggested actions that states and <unk> should take to reduce regulatory barriers the association has proposed no activist legislative program comparable to say its detailed request for more federal subsidies to eliminate <unk> controls <eos>
<bos> the association a majority of whose n members build fewer than n units a year is like many other business <unk> <eos>
<bos> explains <unk> macdonald of the national taxpayers union it <unk> in two <unk> <eos>
<bos> the builders like the subsidies but at the same time they tend to be fiscal conservatives in terms of major issues such as the <unk> amendment <eos>
<bos> unfortunately the organization 's desire for pork tends to override its commitment to overall fiscal responsibility <eos>
<bos> two years ago when the nahb lobbied for the $ n billion omnibus housing bill the organization basically dropped out of the taxpayers ' coalition says ms. macdonald <eos>
<bos> as mr. <unk> of the nahb acknowledges government is not going to solve the problem <eos>
<bos> the real key is to have the economy working and interest rates down <eos>
<bos> more money for hud will increase the deficit and <unk> the economy more money to municipalities that are <unk> their local housing markets will further <unk> them from the <unk> effects of their policies <eos>
<bos> is this what the home builders want <eos>

<bos> the only strong opposition to changing the ec treaty comes from british prime minister margaret thatcher who is opposed to creating a single ec currency <eos>
<bos> but the process of <unk> the <unk> conference does n't require <unk> <eos>
<bos> setting a date to start treaty negotiations has no legal significance in itself but could be viewed as an important psychological push <eos>
<bos> french president <unk> mitterrand fought to set a date for the conference during the ec summit in madrid last june but the move was <unk> because of opposition by mrs. thatcher and west german chancellor helmut kohl <eos>

<bos> the latest <unk> in the equities markets <unk> me of the joke t. boone pickens tells about the guy who was run over by the parade <eos>
<bos> when asked what went wrong the unfortunate victim replied it was a combination of things <eos>
<bos> and so it was on gray friday <eos>
<bos> the grand <unk> of this parade would appear to have been excess leverage <eos>
<bos> even if that is so however it 's probably the case that no barriers should have been <unk> to stop the <unk> before the end of the rout e <eos>
<bos> the <unk> began friday afternoon when word spread that the ual buy-out was <unk> <eos>
<bos> although the <unk> expects to patch together a substitute offer consisting of less cash the failure to get cash from japanese and american banks confirmed a growing fear among arbitragers that the <unk> of <unk> takeover deals is ending <eos>
<bos> lots of other <unk> made up the parade of course notably a surprisingly large increase in producer prices <unk> federal reserve <unk> and the bush administration 's temporary defeat in trying to lower the capital-gains tax <eos>
<bos> as usual few favorable reviews were heard for that <unk> <unk> band of program traders although most serious studies suggest they only play the music that others write <eos>
<bos> what really spooked the <unk> along wall street however was the sudden concern that whatever the reason the pool of debt capital is <unk> up <eos>
<bos> gray friday reflects a panic mainly by the takeover arbitragers rather than the small investor as their highly <unk> investments in the deal stocks are <unk> by the unexpected <unk> up of the <unk> for deal financing <eos>

<bos> the multibillion-dollar prospects where the bidder must line up a consortium of banks <unk> issue billions in high-yield debt were where the damage was concentrated <eos>
<bos> the market for so-called junk bonds has been setting the stage for friday 's dramatic march for several weeks <eos>
<bos> the growing financial difficulties of recent <unk> restructurings or takeovers such as resorts international integrated resources and campeau 's retailing empire have cast a pall over the entire market for high-yield securities <eos>
<bos> investors have reacted by ignoring recent efforts to float junk bonds by ohio <unk> and by forcing ramada to postpone indefinitely its planned junk-bond sale and restructuring <eos>
<bos> as a result high-yield mutual funds have declined across the board and the many firms planning to sell $ n billion in junk bonds before year-end are experiencing anxious times <eos>
<bos> these are all market excesses putting aside the <unk> boosts that the tax code gives to debt over equity and what we 've seen is the market <unk> them in <eos>
<bos> of course washington had n't been silent in the days leading up to the debacle and its tendency to <unk> in the leverage equation remains a troublesome prospect but those preliminary steps should n't <unk> us from the basic market <unk> that was at work on friday <eos>
<bos> if it is correct to find that concerns over corporate debt and lbos caused gray friday what are the implications for policy makers <eos>
<bos> after all the stock market 's response to the collapse of the ual deal might be taken to confirm the <unk> direction of regulators <eos>
<bos> is this a case where private markets are <unk> of washington 's <unk> of wall street <eos>
<bos> absolutely not <eos>
<bos> to the extent that friday 's sell-off reflected a sudden <unk> of the excesses of leverage the message is that wall street and the private markets are fully capable of imposing the appropriate incentives and sanctions on corporate behavior <eos>
<bos> the national economic interests are much better served allowing the private interests of bankers and investors be the ultimate judges of the investment quality of various lbo deals and leveraged restructurings <eos>
<bos> the recent difficulties in the junk-bond markets and the <unk> of bank capital for recent deals <unk> the wisdom of letting the free markets operate <eos>
<bos> if takeover premiums become excessive if lbo <unk> become too aggressive then the private market will recognize these problems more quickly and accurately than will policy makers and the markets will move with <unk> speed to impose appropriate sanctions <eos>
<bos> yes the broader exchanges got caught up in the <unk> but they rode the tiger up all year <eos>
<bos> not surprisingly he sometimes <unk> <eos>
<bos> the arbitragers and takeover <unk> got killed on gray friday while the besieged managers of prospective targets cheered <unk> <eos>
<bos> if you identify with the besieged managers you must concede that <unk> and effective relief from the excesses of the takeover market is more likely to come from the marketplace than from washington <eos>
<bos> if you side with the arbitragers and raiders you clearly have more to fear from private investors than from regulators although the delaware courts should never be underestimated <eos>
<bos> the truth is washington understands politics better than economics <eos>
<bos> although the average citizen is probably not <unk> too much from washington 's <unk> war against wall street regarding excessive financial <unk> actual legislation would probably impose considerable harm <eos>
<bos> any such attempt to <unk> good debt from bad debt or to draw the line at a particular industry such as the airlines is likely to blunt the spur that the proper amount of leverage provides both to equity markets and economic efficiency in general <eos>
<bos> far better for policy makers to concentrate on the war against drugs panama and the deficit all of them <unk> that seem never to end <eos>

<bos> the initiative is based largely on the <unk> of the green lobby the sierra club the league of conservation voters the natural resources defense council the national <unk> campaign and the citizens for a better environment <eos>
<bos> <unk> the environmental defense fund is having nothing to do with this one <eos>
<bos> not only californians but all americans would pay if this thing passed <eos>
<bos> the initiative bars the sale of any crops in california that do n't meet the initiative 's standards <eos>

<bos> but if rational science and economics have nothing to do with the new environment initiative what is going on <eos>
<bos> the first place to look under these circumstances is at the ways in which the sponsors themselves will benefit <eos>
<bos> the key here is the <unk> of state attorney general john van de <unk> <eos>
<bos> he 's running for governor <eos>
<bos> mr. van de <unk> is the one who collected the plans from the various radical environmental groups and <unk> them into a single <unk> initiative to be placed on the ballot for election on nov. n n <eos>
<bos> that 's also the day of the gubernatorial election <eos>
<bos> the initiative seems to have been <unk> to include all the hot issues that set off the wealthy hollywood <unk> who <unk> money <eos>

<bos> this is the state that recently passed the <unk> n <unk> initiative <eos>
<bos> if this new proposal ever does become law the green lobby will benefit directly <eos>
<bos> the initiative creates a free floating state environmental officer to sue companies or government agencies that do things he does n't like <eos>
<bos> that means the <unk> and such groups no longer would have to spend as much money on litigation taxpayers would bear the cost <eos>
