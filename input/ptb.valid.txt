<s> time magazine for example has more than n separate editions going to different regions top management and other groups </s>
<s> another sticking point for advertisers was national geographic 's tradition of <UNK> its ads together usually at the beginning or end of the magazine rather than spreading ads out among its articles as most magazines do </s>
